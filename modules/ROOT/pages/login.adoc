== Login

There are two ways to interact with OpenShift, one is using web console `{openshift-console-url}` and another is via command line interface(CLI).

[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
export WORKSHOP_USER=1
oc login  -u userpass:[$WORKSHOP_USER] {ocpurl}:6443
----

Once you login you will be given access to the following projects:

* `tutorial{namespace-suffix}`
* `user$WORKSHOP_USER-che`(your che workspace)

e.g. you will seen an output like 

```
Login successful.

You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc project <projectname>':

  * istio-system
    tutorial-1
    worksapceeeb5cruggda14ovgm

Using project "istio-system".
```

== Navigating projects

To navigate to a project (namespace), you can use a command :

[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
# oc project <project-name>
oc project tutorial{namespace-suffix}
----

If you have right permissions on the project, you will be shown a message as below 

[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
Now using project "tutorial-1" on server "{ocpurl}".
----

== Query project

To query the project you are in, you can use a command :

[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc project -q
----

As we have are in project `tutorial-pass:[$WORKSHOP_USER]`, the command above should return you ``tutorial-pass:[$WORKSHOP_USER]``

We will explore more on the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) as we progress through the workshop and its exercises.
